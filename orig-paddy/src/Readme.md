## Paddy for Lightroom sources

You'll have to dig through sourceforge, forum, contact people on the old forum, etc. And try and put them together.

4.x sources

https://sourceforge.net/projects/paddy/files/96%20Archive%20%28all%20files%20incl.%20source%20code%29/

Excel spreadsheets and such that might be involved. Forum and web archive digging.

5.x source (paddy5exe.src)

What is here is a decompiled source. Which I had to go spelunking in. Diff against 4.x sources, and all the random bits collected.
